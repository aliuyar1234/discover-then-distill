# LaTeX source

## Build
From this directory:

```bash
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex
```

Notes:
- This package uses a **manual bibliography** (`references_manual.tex`) so it builds in environments without `bibtex`.
- Figures are expected under `../figs_compute_v2/` (generated by scripts in `../scripts/`).
